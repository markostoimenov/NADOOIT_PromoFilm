Don't bring people together entrepreneurs customers and also the employees existing constant conflicts with each other while employees want to have maximum free time, they would of course also want to earn money shopping entrepreneurs want to pay the lowest possible salaries in order to offer customers low prices and earn maximum profiles. 

If we can bring all three parties together and suddenly a new dynamic arises in which employees want to bring maximum value to the company. 
If they are part of the company, they benefit from further income from the company, so the workers become shareholders in their own work for the first time - they own part of their work You keep what you create in a company regardless of its affiliation. 

This means that regardless of whether the employee moves from company to company, he still has an interest in a former employer continuing to stand there and continue to grow in his affiliation. 

For example, someone who is now leaving a company has nothing to gain from really being involved in the company before. 

Now Have you seen? It doesn't matter if I work particularly well, it doesn't matter how much improvement I bring to the company, because maybe that's what I can do Or I can get a promotion because of it, but most of the time in the end, only the entrepreneur would benefit greatly, why should they change? 

New automation just means they have to do more work? 

So why should you join? 

They are also new in the sense that they are confronted with taking on new work because suddenly the work they were doing before is done in a very short time and they are allowed to go home earlier. 

No, they get new work, especially today with the shortage of skilled workers, more and more tasks are being distributed on fewer and fewer shoulders, which means a small number of people only have to do the work and the work of many people who have retired is done. 

For this you need to automate generational change cannot be mastered without automation. 

The current systems do not offer any additional benefits for employees. 

That we will introduce employees to share in their own work? 

But we should talk about the problem now. 

The best way to get to the bottom of the problem is to look at the economic system and look at the green energy to maximize the problem of economic systems that help people. 

Money is the only thing valued in our economy. 

All economic activity is designed to produce maximum money money the problem. 

The only thing is that the economy has figured out that the best way to produce maximum money is economic crises, one economic crisis after another follows us. 

Why not because the economy could no longer do more, but because it is not allowed to do so? 
The economic system itself has recognized that failing systems lead to more money being produced at exactly this point, a new one for the economy for the first time Goal a goal that is in the interest of people. 

Because more time is what everyone wants, people are looking for the opportunity to get out of the system in work so that they have more time for family hobbies and other nice things that we would much rather do than work, the original promise of automation knows that we will work less and less. 

The founders of the IT industry said that we would now work less than four days, oh, what less than three, what is it, we are now talking about introducing a 48-hour week, there is talk about abolishing public holidays, there is talk about it to push the pension further and further into the future in order to somehow master the worksheet. 

How can we prevent this by using automation, but the existing systems in the IT industry have no interest in actually leading to less work being done and are all geared towards simply selling more software, regardless of whether it really is brings an advantage to humanity. 

Well, you would have changed what we produce as an IT company, we don't produce software. Software is a tool that allows us to produce what everyone wants to have more time more time for things.
