It turns everything in our society into money every form of human action our relationships our work our products. 

Our environment is all being turned into money, that is a goal in the AI ​​industry they call it that the goal of the economy alone is not brought together with the interest of humanity. 
Previously this was not the case because we are still a human product had something that we all wanted Gold Gold Gold Gold was interesting for us.

From which we all benefited, but that is over the moment 1960s golden physical goods were separated from the economy and so the economy was no longer capable of good things Who to produce became one only to the only value and that is money.
