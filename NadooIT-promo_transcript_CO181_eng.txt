The company is running. 

Do you have the first customers active in this new economy? 

We actually pay our customers the money at the end, that is, so okay, like like like like how how do I get in how do I start so we have? 

Have we created a system where our users get paid? 

We pay our users to use our software.



If you ask for money so that your software can be used, our partners get money for using the software because we only get money if our software really creates added value for the customer. 

Both our end users who use our tool and actively help to improve and develop it will share in our revenue, as will the entrepreneur who has given us access to his business processes. 

This gives everyone involved a prophet, the developer who developed the software, the opportunity to generate an income in the long term and not be stuck in the current project business service relationships and go from project to project throughout your life, which project managers have always hated continues to be incentivized to produce more and more software instead that has time to produce good good secure software. 

Our parents walls no longer need to worry about what they will do if they lose their job because their work on dad has become superfluous. 
For many people, their income is incredibly dangerous. 

We have created the economic system now that you the future is made of AI. 

All we're going to do now is expand it, get bigger and initiate the next stage, the next phase.



Reality will happen in the future. 

The only thing that needs to change now is that a lot more of you will hear about it in the future, because this system is made for all of us, it is a gift for all of us, it is open to everyone. 

Anyone can copy it, it can be accessed by everyone because no one can.



We have already gained the first partners and the first tools are already in circulation. 

The first time has already been created. 

They have more than doubled the number of our developers in the last few months, and we are growing every month as the economy grows. 

In the next few years we only plan to expand this system and use our own currency, just as cryptocurrencies have tried to expand, and then later create a team that is open to many more people and can be copied and spread all over the world , because this is not one system, but it is the system for all of us. 

I've waited years for this. 

Should I do that? 

I thought for 8 years whether this system was actually an improvement on what we have now. 

Now is the moment AI has shown that we no longer have time for therapy development in this industry shows that we will massively in the next few years. 

Hundreds of thousands if I were millions of people would lose their jobs and not benefit from it. 

Sam open the inventor or one of the co-founders of Open AIDS is convinced that the University basic in Kamen will solve the problem. 

No idea whatsoever. 

He didn't offer a solution and neither did anyone else, we have a real solution that exists now. 

We are growing. 

We Keep expanding.



NadooIT exists now. 

We are currently building the platform, the contracts are currently being drawn up, the first developers are already working so our partners are using our software and are already buying time from us. 

In the next few months the number of developers will more than double, triple, quadruple, and our partners will continue to add more and more. 

The only question is how fast we are growing, not whether next year the platform will be published on which everyone can register as companies developers or those who want to become developers, who want to create the time and thus break out of the existing economy and finally into an economy to change that is focused on people. 

In the next few years, the economy in which we find ourselves will grow in the IT economy and ultimately become so large in the following years that it will be able to trade with our own currency for the first time. 

This currency is not simple cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Xperia if it is based on the time I was created as having more value in this company. 

have created They pass on to the people who work on our platform, the companies, the entrepreneurs, the employees and everyone who later decides to join our system.
